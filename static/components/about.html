                <h3>My Journey</h3>
                <p>My journey in technology began with a deep-seated curiosity about how software and data could be
                    leveraged to solve real-world complexities. I recently completed my <strong>BE in Computer Science
                        Engineering (2020–2024)</strong>, where I laid a strong foundation in software development and
                    specialized in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.</p>
                <p>During my undergraduate years, I focused on building not just learning. My passion for Computer
                    Vision led
                    to a <strong>published research paper</strong> on Movie Character Recognition using Deep Learning,
                    which successfully bridged the gap between academic research and practical AI applications. This
                    research-focused mindset continues to drive my approach to building intelligent systems.</p>
                <p>Most recently, I served as a <strong>Machine Learning Engineer at Newgen Technomate LLP
                        (2024–2026)</strong>. In this role, I spearheaded the development of high-impact healthcare
                    solutions, such as an Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) prediction system that achieves 92% accuracy.
                    Beyond my professional roles, I actively build end-to-end applications like <strong>StoxAi</strong>
                    and <strong>AskMyDocs</strong>,
                    combining robust backend engineering (FastAPI/Flask) with advanced AI techniques like LSTMs and RAG
                    to create tools that are both intelligent and user-centric.</p>
